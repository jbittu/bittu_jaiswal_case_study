They also express extreme dissatisfaction, but the inability to log in takes precedence.\nPriority Reason: The user reports an inability to log in, which constitutes a complete service outage. This aligns with the criteria for a 'critical' priority, regardless of customer tier or revenue.\nRouting Reason: The inability to log in and the description of the product as 'completely broken' indicates a technical issue requiring immediate attention and likely engineering intervention. The urgent sentiment and critical priority further reinforce this routing."

It's a factual observation, not a feature request or critical problem.\nPriority Reason: The issue is a minor UI problem (misaligned dashboard numbers on mobile), not a service outage, data loss, or security concern. Despite the customer being enterprise and generating significant revenue, the impact is minimal, thus 'low' priority is appropriate.\nRouting Reason: The issue is described as a 'UI issue,' specifically misalignment of numbers on the dashboard. This falls under technical problems requiring engineering to investigate and resolve. While the customer is enterprise, the issue itself is a minor technical bug. Thus, routing to Technical_Support."

The sentiment is positive, indicating no immediate frustration with the current system. The issue can be addressed in a reasonable timeframe without causing significant disruption. Therefore a 'medium' priority is appropriate.\nRouting Reason: The customer explicitly requests a new feature (bulk export), which falls under the Feature_Request department.

This is causing them frustration and indicates a problem with the service or documentation.\nPriority Reason: The customer is a premium tier and is encountering an issue that directly impacts their ability to use the API effectively, resulting in a negative sentiment. The API rate limits issue prevents them from utilizing their purchased service as expected. Although not a complete outage, the discrepancy between documented limits and actual performance significantly degrades their service, warranting a 'high' priority.\nRouting Reason: The issue involves API rate limits and a discrepancy with documented limits, indicating a potential bug or configuration issue. This falls under technical troubleshooting and requires engineering intervention. The customer's premium tier and high priority further support routing to Technical Support."
